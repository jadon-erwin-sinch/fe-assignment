This is a dummy application used for the sole purpose of determining the technical qualifications of SR. FE candidates. An experienced FE engineer might be able to fix all of the issues in 1-2 hours (on a good day). Please do not spend more than 2 hours on this task even if it means not completing all of the tasks. You do not need to fix the issues in order. Please leave the 

There are 4 issues with the application:
1) Two buttons need styling (edit and delete)
2) Notifications are not showing up (we are using toast notifications)
3) The back-button isn't doing anything
4) The "delete app" API isn't working
***

### *** Please note this app uses a shared server. Anything you do will saved on the server visible to others. Be sure to add new apps for testing out the delete API
***

## Task Details:

### 1) Demonstrate your ability to style html components. 
Style the Edit and Delete buttons, one using inline CSS and the other using a CSS/Style Framework of your choosing (MUI, Bootstrap, Tailwind, Styled Components, etc.)

```
toast.success("Application successfully updated")

When working properly a toast notification will appear in the top-right of the application:

Clicking the delete button doens't do anything
